                "I became involved with TEDxUofW last year as a Finance Manager for the event. I've been a big fan of TED talks since high school, but it wasn't until a good friend (one of last year's curators) recruited me that I really became immersed in the TED brand. Despite my busy schedule, I knew I had to get involved again this year, and was thrilled when I became one of the curators. I love TED's mission of "ideas worth spreading" and the inspiration that stems from a variety of topics, from technology to human behavior to many other things.
                My favorite TED talk is called "The Power of Vulnerability", presented by Brene Brown. She discusses human connection and interaction, which I find fascinating and extremely relevant in my own life. This is what I think is so great about TED- the ability to inspire and motivate people to take what they've learned, and apply it to their own lives to transcend in the way that people think, feel and act."

I was an Event Day Manager last year for the swag committee and had the time of my life working with my friends to plan for the event. I think what I love most about TEDxUofW is seeing such a diverse group of like-minded students come together to work towards a common goal - putting on the best TEDxUofW conference we can!

TED's tagline "Ideas Worth Spending" encapsulates the organization's novel capability of contributing to the development of human consciousness. My personal favorite TEDTalk is Dan Pallota's talk: "The Way We Think About Charity is Dead Wrong". Pallota asserts that in order to empower the non-profit world to have a more significant impact on global problems, we must shift the way we think about charities and the way they operate. I think this talk also fits in well with this year's TEDxUofW theme "Transcend with TED".

                "TED talks are exceptional because they expose the audience to amazing individuals who may be known only in their field. The courageous, the funny, the artistic, the practical, the persuasive, the focused, and the ingenious are the voices of TED. I'm excited to be a part of the speaker selection committee and continue the tradition of bringing and highlighting the inspiring voices of technology, education and design on our campus.
                A talk that that I recently watched that changed my perspective on human/environment relationships is titled My Mushroom Burial Suit, given by Jae Rhim Lee. I think that it is remarkably inventive!"
