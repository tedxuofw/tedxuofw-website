    Nathan White is a UW faculty member and an emergency physician at Harborview Medical Center. Stopping bleeding has been his passion since he first set foot in the trauma bay and had blood spilled on his fancy new shoes during his first day of medical rotations in a busy Emergency Department in inner city Detroit. Borrowing from the strategies set forth the in the "Art of War" by Sun Tzu: know yourself, know your enemy, exploit weaknesses, keep humble, and victory without fighting, Dr. White has developed his own strategy for the battle against bleeding. As a result, he is creating a new portable microfluidic monitor to quickly identify clotting defects after injury, and an injectable synthetic polymer that bolsters clot formation to stop bleeding in its tracks.  Dr. White will highlight his experiences in the battle against bleeding to convey to the TEDx audience that no problem is insurmountable if you take the time to understand it, remain humble, and yet be bold when the opportunity arises.

    Born and raised in Chicagoland (Glen Ellyn), Megan Roake is a second-year undergraduate at the University of Washington, double majoring in psychology and law, and justice. She is a triplet with two brothers. Megan is not afraid to confront the difficult, controversial, and “awkward” topic of sexual assault and relationship violence. In fact, she concentrates extensively on crisis, trauma, and recovery in regards to sexual assault and mental illness; she even plans to focus her academic degrees in these matters, merging her personal experiences and professional interests. In response to her own rape, she partakes in and challenges informal and formal legal processes, prevention and advocacy organizations, and personal recovery. Her activism is grounded in her firm belief in the importance of challenging society’s ideas about consent and sexual assault itself as well as the extreme importance of creating strong and sustainable communities of survivors and allies. These ideas on trauma and healing were recently emphasized in her opinion piece featured in the University of Washington school newspaper: "To my supporters, I couldn’t do it without you" (UW Daily 02/27/2015).

    Nikkita Oliver is poet, teaching artist, community organizer, and activist working toward a Juris Doctorate (June 2015) and a Masters of Education (March 2016). She has competed in multiple National Poetry Slam Competitions and recently coached the Seattle Poetry Slam team to 7th of 72 teams at the 2015 National Poetry Slam in Oakland, CA. She has performed in venues in New York City, Seattle, Boston, Oakland, Olympia and Everett where she opened for Dr. Cornell West. Nikkita's idea worth spreading brings to light the power of art to make change. It has been said, "In any war the first thing you do is kill off the poets and the philosophers..." Why?, she asks. Because these are the inspirers, the preservers of culture and record, the communal conscious, the deep thinkers and movement starters, the light bearers, and whistleblowers. When we investigate the history of social change movements, we often find artists, poets and philosophers at the forefront. Art has the power to open hearts and minds in unsuspecting and powerful ways to create the necessary internal and external climate needed for individual and systemic social change.
